On Halloween, I was listening to pirate radio!

I recorded the audio, this is mostly me flipping between Radio Genix and Outhouse Radio, but also occasionally scanning around to see if any new stations were popping up:

You can hear SSTV all over, just clicking around I hear some at 16 minutes, and around 50 minutes. Here's what happens if you play that audio into MMSSTV or QSSTV or the iOS app SSTV or countless others:

How cool is this? If this doesn't count as "radio art", I don't know what does!
